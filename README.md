NetCDF_manip
============

A repository to assist with manipulating netcdf files. Merging, pruning, renaming varaibles, creating 1D profiles from 3D files.

These files will require ncdfView, written by Momme, but can be changed to not required. 
Replace ncdfView with netCDF4.Dataset, and nc(key) with nc.variables[key]
